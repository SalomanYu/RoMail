# RoMail
This application is the desktop version of Gmail. It differs in that it can only be used to send messages. There is no way to view the inbox list in this application, it was created exclusively for sending messages.


In order to use it, you need to fill in the input fields. You can also attach your own files of any format (pdf, jpeg, txt, py, mp3, mp4, mov and so on)

You can install the necessary libraries yourself by using the file required_lib.txt . Or you can run the script for automatic installation with the command ./install.sh
